# RuneScape Ping Checker
A simple tool that checks the ping of runescape worlds.

Designed to take away the guesswork from hopping worlds.

This is an early alpha. Tested on mac.

## Usage
1. Set a range of worlds you would like to check with `WORLD_MIN` and `WORLD_MAX`. Note for old school runescape, world 301 is equivalent to oldschool 1, 302 = oldschool 2, etc.
2. Set either `oldschool` or `runescape` for GAME to indicate game type
